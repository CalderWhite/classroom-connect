Jamhacks hack (1st Place!)

**Note:** The code you see isn't the code that won the hackathon. That code can be found [here](https://github.com/CalderWhite/classroom-connect/tree/original), which is the branch named original. This was in fact written in Node.js, and the styling isn't entirely complete.
