# Ideas 

Here's out ideas. Perhaps this'll act as a description/mini docs during the hackathon, and     
we can simply reload the `README.md`

## School Connection platform

This app will allow students to connect with other students to study/work on projects.    
If a student recives enough high grades and credits, they may be _promoted_ to a _tutor_,    
where we, and that student can make money off those in need.
